# README

This repository contains exclusive codes for screening multiple protein sequences. 

The screening_fasta.py reads a fasta file containing multiple protein sequences. It checks whether a protein sequence is composed of invalid amino acids. If the file does, it removes the invalid characters, and writes a formatted file in the same file location.

The python code uses Biopython for parsing the input fasta file.
